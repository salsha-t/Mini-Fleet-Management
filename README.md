# Mini Fleet Management
Mini Fleet Management is an Android application built using Kotlin that monitors various parameters of a fleet, such as vehicle speed, door status, and engine status. The application displays live updates and issues alerts via dialog boxes and notifications if certain thresholds are exceeded (e.g., high speed, open door, or engine off).
